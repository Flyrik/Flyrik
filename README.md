# Hi 👋 my name is Florian
## Future developer in extended reality and AI

💻 Passionate about development, I have explored programming languages such as C, Java, and Python, as well as Unity. Through various enriching internships, I discovered my strong passion for 3D technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) — two fields that allow me to combine creativity and technical innovation.

🚀 As I ventured into the fascinating world of 3D, I gained experience with tools like Blender, Unity, and Unreal Engine, and began developing AR (Augmented Reality) and VR (Virtual Reality) projects using Unity. In parallel, I have explored the potential of AI to enhance interactivity, realism, and automation in digital environments.

🔐 With a unique blend of coding, AI, and 3D design skills, I focus on optimizing workflows, solving complex technical challenges, and creating immersive, intelligent virtual experiences.

🌐 Always eager to learn, I am passionate about game development, virtual and augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and 3D modeling. My curiosity drives me to explore new technologies and contribute to innovative, immersive, and intelligent 3D projects. 🛡️💻

* 🌍 I'm based in Paris.
* ✉️ You can contact me at florian@poscente.fr.
* 🧠 Currently, I am expanding my skills in 3D and IA development. I am exploring various aspects of the field, including virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). I actively participate in hands-on experiments using VR headsets and work on personal projects to deepen my understanding of 3D design and development.
* 🚀 With a keen interest in creating immersive experiences, I am experimenting with different tools and technologies to bring my ideas to life. My goal is to blend creativity and technical expertise, pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved in the realm of 3D. 🎮✨
